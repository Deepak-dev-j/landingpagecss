            <p class="mt-6">Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark,
                 a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. 
                 When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man 
                 armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight,
                  energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in 
                  response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable pro-war character.

            <p>
                Vision, also known as sight, is the process by which the eyes, retinas, optic nerves, 
                and brain work together to create the ability to see. It's a primary sense that allows
                 individuals to perceive the world around them. Vision involves the conversion of
                 light into electrical signals that are then interpreted by the brain.
